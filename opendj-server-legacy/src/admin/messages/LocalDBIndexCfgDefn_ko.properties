synopsis=Local DB Indexes are used to store information that makes it possible to locate entries very quickly when processing search operations.
description=Indexing is performed on a per-attribute level and different types of indexing may be performed for different kinds of attributes, based on how they are expected to be accessed during search operations.
property.attribute.synopsis=Specifies the name of the attribute for which the index is to be maintained.
property.index-entry-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of entries that are allowed to match a given index key before that particular index key is no longer maintained.
property.index-entry-limit.description=This is analogous to the ALL IDs threshold in the Sun Java System Directory Server. If this is specified, its value overrides the JE backend-wide configuration. For no limit, use 0 for the value.
property.index-entry-limit.requires-admin-action.synopsis=If any index keys have already reached this limit, indexes must be rebuilt before they will be allowed to use the new limit.
property.index-type.synopsis=Specifies the type(s) of indexing that should be performed for the associated attribute.
property.index-type.description=For equality, presence, and substring index types, the associated attribute type must have a corresponding matching rule.
property.index-type.requires-admin-action.synopsis=If any new index types are added for an attribute, and values for that attribute already exist in the database, the index must be rebuilt before it will be accurate.
property.index-type.syntax.enumeration.value.approximate.synopsis=This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using approximate matching search filters.
property.index-type.syntax.enumeration.value.equality.synopsis=This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using equality search filters.
property.index-type.syntax.enumeration.value.ordering.synopsis=This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using "greater than or equal to" or "less then or equal to" search filters.
property.index-type.syntax.enumeration.value.presence.synopsis=This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using the presence search filters.
property.index-type.syntax.enumeration.value.substring.synopsis=This index type is used to improve the efficiency of searches using substring search filters.
property.substring-length.synopsis=The length of substrings in a substring index.
property.substring-length.requires-admin-action.synopsis=The index must be rebuilt before it will reflect the new value.
