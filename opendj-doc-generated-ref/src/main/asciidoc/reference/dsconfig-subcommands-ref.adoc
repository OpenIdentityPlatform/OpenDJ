db-evictor-nodes-per-scan::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of Btree nodes that should be evicted from the cache in a single pass if it is determined that it is necessary to free existing data in order to make room for new information. Changes to this property do not take effect until the backend is restarted. It is recommended that you also change this property when you set db-evictor-lru-only to false. This setting controls the number of Btree nodes that are considered, or sampled, each time a node is evicted. A setting of 10 often produces good results, but this may vary from application to application. The larger the nodes per scan, the more accurate the algorithm. However, don't set it too high. When considering larger numbers of nodes for each eviction, the evictor may delay the completion of a given database operation, which impacts the response time of the application thread. In JE 4.1 and later, setting this value too high in an application that is largely CPU bound can reduce the effectiveness of cache eviction. It's best to start with the default value, and increase it gradually to see if it is beneficial for your application.

Description::
Specifies the size of the file handle cache. The file handle cache is used to keep as much opened log files as possible. When the cache is smaller than the number of logs, the database needs to close some handles and open log files it needs, resulting in less optimal performances. Ideally, the size of the cache should be higher than the number of files contained in the database. Make sure the OS number of open files per process is also tuned appropriately.

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::
700

Allowed Values::
Any octal value between 700 and 777 (the owner must always have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory).

index-filter-analyzer-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks.

character-set::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies a character set containing characters that a password may contain and a value indicating the minimum number of characters required from that set. Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the set which may be zero, indicating that the character set is optional) followed by a colon and the characters to include in that set (for example, "3:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" indicates that a user password must contain at least three characters from the set of lowercase ASCII letters). Multiple character sets can be defined in separate values, although no character can appear in more than one character set.

Default Value::
If no sets are specified, the validator only uses the defined character ranges.

Allowed Values::
A String

Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the range which may be zero, indicating that the character range is optional) followed by a colon and one or more range specifications. A range specification is 3 characters: the first character allowed, a minus, and the last character allowed. For example, "3:A-Za-z0-9". The ranges in each value should not overlap, and the characters in each range specification should be ordered.

Default Value::
If no ranges are specified, the validator only uses the defined character sets.

min-character-sets::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the minimum number of character sets and ranges that a password must contain. This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets and ranges (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets and ranges (those requiring greater than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets and ranges, and characters from at least N optional character sets and ranges. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.

Default Value::
The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and ranges and, if there are optional character sets and ranges, at least one character from one of the optional character sets and ranges.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

======

not-assured::
Assured replication is not enabled. Updates sent for replication (for being replayed on other LDAP servers in the topology) are sent without waiting for any acknowledgment and the LDAP client call returns immediately.

safe-data::
Assured replication is enabled in Safe Data mode: updates sent for replication are subject to acknowledgment from the replication servers that have the same group ID as the local server (defined with the group-id property). The number of acknowledgments to expect is defined by the assured-sd-level property. After acknowledgments are received, LDAP client call returns.

safe-read::
Assured replication is enabled in Safe Read mode: updates sent for replication are subject to acknowledgments from the LDAP servers in the topology that have the same group ID as the local server (defined with the group-id property). After acknowledgments are received, LDAP client call returns.

assured-timeout::
[open]
====

Description::
The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments. Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.

Default Value::
1000ms

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

* `w`: weeks

+
Lower limit is 1 milliseconds.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No

====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is "algorithm/mode/padding". The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::
700

Allowed Values::
Any octal value between 700 and 777 (the owner must always have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory).

db-evictor-lru-only::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the database should evict existing data from the cache based on an LRU policy (where the least recently used information will be evicted first). If set to "false", then the eviction keeps internal nodes of the underlying Btree in the cache over leaf nodes, even if the leaf nodes have been accessed more recently. This may be a better configuration for databases in which only a very small portion of the data is cached.

Default Value::
false

====

db-evictor-nodes-per-scan::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of Btree nodes that should be evicted from the cache in a single pass if it is determined that it is necessary to free existing data in order to make room for new information. Changes to this property do not take effect until the backend is restarted. It is recommended that you also change this property when you set db-evictor-lru-only to false. This setting controls the number of Btree nodes that are considered, or sampled, each time a node is evicted. A setting of 10 often produces good results, but this may vary from application to application. The larger the nodes per scan, the more accurate the algorithm. However, don't set it too high. When considering larger numbers of nodes for each eviction, the evictor may delay the completion of a given database operation, which impacts the response time of the application thread. In JE 4.1 and later, setting this value too high in an application that is largely CPU bound can reduce the effectiveness of cache eviction. It's best to start with the default value, and increase it gradually to see if it is beneficial for your application.

Default Value::
10

====

db-log-filecache-size::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the size of the file handle cache. The file handle cache is used to keep as much opened log files as possible. When the cache is smaller than the number of logs, the database needs to close some handles and open log files it needs, resulting in less optimal performances. Ideally, the size of the cache should be higher than the number of files contained in the database. Make sure the OS number of open files per process is also tuned appropriately.

Default Value::
100

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 3. Upper value is 2147483647.

db-run-cleaner::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the cleaner threads should be enabled to compact the database. The cleaner threads are used to periodically compact the database when it reaches a percentage of occupancy lower than the amount specified by the db-cleaner-min-utilization property. They identify database files with a low percentage of live data, and relocate their remaining live data to the end of the log.

Default Value::
true

Allowed Values::
true

No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
Yes (Use --advanced in interactive mode.)

Read-only::
No

====

db-txn-no-sync::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether database writes should be primarily written to an internal buffer but not immediately written to disk. Setting the value of this configuration attribute to "true" may improve write performance but could cause the most recent changes to be lost if the OpenDJ directory server or the underlying JVM exits abnormally, or if an OS or hardware failure occurs (a behavior similar to running with transaction durability disabled in the Sun Java System Directory Server).

db-txn-write-no-sync::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the database should synchronously flush data as it is written to disk. If this value is set to "false", then all data written to disk is synchronously flushed to persistent storage and thereby providing full durability. If it is set to "true", then data may be cached for a period of time by the underlying operating system before actually being written to disk. This may improve performance, but could cause the most recent changes to be lost in the event of an underlying OS or hardware failure (but not in the case that the OpenDJ directory server or the JVM exits abnormally).

index-filter-analyzer-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::
700

index-filter-analyzer-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

use-tcp-keep-alive::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether LDAP connections should use TCP keep-alive. If enabled, the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is used to indicate that TCP keepalive messages should periodically be sent to the client to verify that the associated connection is still valid. This may also help prevent cases in which intermediate network hardware could silently drop an otherwise idle client connection, provided that the keepalive interval configured in the underlying operating system is smaller than the timeout enforced by the network hardware.

use-tcp-no-delay::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether LDAP connections should use TCP no-delay. If enabled, the TCP_NODELAY socket option is used to ensure that response messages to the client are sent immediately rather than potentially waiting to determine whether additional response messages can be sent in the same packet. In most cases, using the TCP_NODELAY socket option provides better performance and lower response times, but disabling it may help for some cases in which the server sends a large number of entries to a client in response to a search request.

[open]
====

Description::
Specifies how the server deals with the inability to update password policy state information during an authentication attempt. In particular, this property can be used to control whether an otherwise successful bind operation fails if a failure occurs while attempting to update password policy state information (for example, to clear a record of previous authentication failures or to update the last login time). It can also be used to control whether to reject a bind request if it is known ahead of time that it will not be possible to update the authentication failure times in the event of an unsuccessful bind attempt (for example, if the backend writability mode is disabled).

Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the set which may be zero, indicating that the character set is optional) followed by a colon and the characters to include in that set (for example, "3:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" indicates that a user password must contain at least three characters from the set of lowercase ASCII letters). Multiple character sets can be defined in separate values, although no character can appear in more than one character set.

Default Value::
If no sets are specified, the validator only uses the defined character ranges.

Allowed Values::

min-character-sets::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the minimum number of character sets and ranges that a password must contain. This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets and ranges (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets and ranges (those requiring greater than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets and ranges, and characters from at least N optional character sets and ranges. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.

Default Value::
The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and ranges and, if there are optional character sets and ranges, at least one character from one of the optional character sets and ranges.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

Description::
Specifies the base DN(s) for the data that the backend handles. A single backend may be responsible for one or more base DNs. Note that no two backends may have the same base DN although one backend may have a base DN that is below a base DN provided by another backend (similar to the use of sub-suffixes in the Sun Java System Directory Server). If any of the base DNs is subordinate to a base DN for another backend, then all base DNs for that backend must be subordinate to that same base DN.

Default Value::
None

Allowed Values::
A valid DN.

Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
Yes

Admin Action Required::
None

+
No administrative action is required by default although some action may be required on a per-backend basis before the new base DN may be used.

Advanced Property::

Description::
Indicates whether the database should evict existing data from the cache based on an LRU policy (where the least recently used information will be evicted first). If set to "false", then the eviction keeps internal nodes of the underlying Btree in the cache over leaf nodes, even if the leaf nodes have been accessed more recently.

db-evictor-nodes-per-scan::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of Btree nodes that should be evicted from the cache in a single pass if it is determined that it is necessary to free existing data in order to make room for new information. Changes to this property do not take effect until the backend is restarted. It is recommended that you also change this property when you set db-evictor-lru-only to false. This setting controls the number of Btree nodes that are considered, or sampled, each time a node is evicted. A setting of 10 often produces good results, but this may vary from application to application. The larger the nodes per scan, the more accurate the algorithm. However, don't set it too high. When considering larger numbers of nodes for each eviction, the evictor may delay the completion of a given database operation, which impacts the response time of the application thread. In JE 4.1 and later, setting this value too high in an application that is largely CPU bound can reduce the effectiveness of cache eviction. It's best to start with the default value, and increase it gradually to see if it is beneficial for your application.

db-log-filecache-size::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the size of the file handle cache. The file handle cache is used to keep as much opened log files as possible. When the cache is smaller than the number of logs, the database needs to close some handles and open log files it needs, resulting in less optimal performances. Ideally, the size of the cache should be higher than the number of files contained in the database. Make sure the OS number of open files per process is also tuned appropriately.

====

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::
700

Allowed Values::
Any octal value between 700 and 777 (the owner must always have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory).

index-filter-analyzer-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether to gather statistical information about the search filters processed by the directory server while evaluating the usage of indexes. Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example.

The ranges in each value should not overlap, and the characters in each range specification should be ordered.

Default Value::
If no ranges are specified, the validator only uses the defined character sets.

min-character-sets::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the minimum number of character sets and ranges that a password must contain. This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets and ranges (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets and ranges (those requiring greater than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets and ranges, and characters from at least N optional character sets and ranges. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.

Default Value::
The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and ranges and, if there are optional character sets and ranges, at least one character from one of the optional character sets and ranges.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is "algorithm/mode/padding". The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.

Default Value::
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

confidentiality-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the replication change-log should make records readable only by Directory Server. Throughput and disk space are affected by the more expensive operations taking place. Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting records on all domains managed by this replication server. Encrypting the records prevents unauthorized parties from accessing contents of LDAP operations. For complete protection, consider enabling secure communications between servers. Change number indexing is not affected by the setting.

Default Value::
false

Description::
The number of pending changes as threshold value for putting a directory server in degraded status. This value represents a number of pending changes a replication server has in queue for sending to a directory server. Once this value is crossed, the matching directory server goes in degraded status. When number of pending changes goes back under this value, the directory server is put back in normal status. 0 means status analyzer is disabled and directory servers are never put in degraded status.

Default Value::
5000

monitoring-period::
[open]
====

Description::
The period between sending of monitoring messages. Defines the duration that the replication server will wait before sending new monitoring messages to its peers (replication servers and directory servers). Larger values increase the length of time it takes for a directory server to detect and switch to a more suitable replication server, whereas smaller values increase the amount of background network traffic.

Default Value::
60s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

When combined together, the weights of the replication servers of a same group can be translated to a percentage that determines the quantity of directory servers of the topology that should be connected to a replication server. For instance imagine a topology with 3 replication servers (with the same group id) with the following weights: RS1=1, RS2=1, RS3=2. This means that RS1 should have 25% of the directory servers connected in the topology, RS2 25%, and RS3 50%. This may be useful if the replication servers of the topology have a different power and one wants to spread the load between the replication servers according to their power.

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

db-evictor-lru-only::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the database should evict existing data from the cache based on an LRU policy (where the least recently used information will be evicted first). If set to "false", then the eviction keeps internal nodes of the underlying Btree in the cache over leaf nodes, even if the leaf nodes have been accessed more recently. This may be a better configuration for databases in which only a very small portion of the data is cached.

Default Value::
false

====

db-evictor-nodes-per-scan::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of Btree nodes that should be evicted from the cache in a single pass if it is determined that it is necessary to free existing data in order to make room for new information. Changes to this property do not take effect until the backend is restarted. It is recommended that you also change this property when you set db-evictor-lru-only to false. This setting controls the number of Btree nodes that are considered, or sampled, each time a node is evicted. A setting of 10 often produces good results, but this may vary from application to application. The larger the nodes per scan, the more accurate the algorithm. However, don't set it too high. When considering larger numbers of nodes for each eviction, the evictor may delay the completion of a given database operation, which impacts the response time of the application thread. In JE 4.1 and later, setting this value too high in an application that is largely CPU bound can reduce the effectiveness of cache eviction. It's best to start with the default value, and increase it gradually to see if it is beneficial for your application.

Default Value::
10

====

db-log-filecache-size::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the size of the file handle cache. The file handle cache is used to keep as much opened log files as possible. When the cache is smaller than the number of logs, the database needs to close some handles and open log files it needs, resulting in less optimal performances. Ideally, the size of the cache should be higher than the number of files contained in the database. Make sure the OS number of open files per process is also tuned appropriately.

db-run-cleaner::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the cleaner threads should be enabled to compact the database. The cleaner threads are used to periodically compact the database when it reaches a percentage of occupancy lower than the amount specified by the db-cleaner-min-utilization property. They identify database files with a low percentage of live data, and relocate their remaining live data to the end of the log.

db-txn-no-sync::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether database writes should be primarily written to an internal buffer but not immediately written to disk. Setting the value of this configuration attribute to "true" may improve write performance but could cause the most recent changes to be lost if the OpenDJ directory server or the underlying JVM exits abnormally, or if an OS or hardware failure occurs (a behavior similar to running with transaction durability disabled in the Sun Java System Directory Server).

Description::
Indicates whether the database should synchronously flush data as it is written to disk. If this value is set to "false", then all data written to disk is synchronously flushed to persistent storage and thereby providing full durability. If it is set to "true", then data may be cached for a period of time by the underlying operating system before actually being written to disk. This may improve performance, but could cause the most recent changes to be lost in the event of an underlying OS or hardware failure (but not in the case that the OpenDJ directory server or the JVM exits abnormally).

Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

* `w`: weeks

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::
700

When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

use-tcp-keep-alive::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the LDAP Connection Handler should use TCP keep-alive. If enabled, the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is used to indicate that TCP keepalive messages should periodically be sent to the client to verify that the associated connection is still valid. This may also help prevent cases in which intermediate network hardware could silently drop an otherwise idle client connection, provided that the keepalive interval configured in the underlying operating system is smaller than the timeout enforced by the network hardware.

password-history-duration::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the maximum length of time that passwords remain in the password history. When choosing a new password, the proposed password is checked to ensure that it does not match the current password, nor any other password in the history list. A value of zero seconds indicates that either no password history is to be maintained (if the password history count has a value of zero), or that there is no maximum duration for passwords in the history (if the password history count has a value greater than zero).

Default Value::
0 seconds

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

* `w`: weeks

[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the time by which all users with the associated password policy must change their passwords. The value is expressed in a generalized time format. If this time is equal to the current time or is in the past, then all users are required to change their passwords immediately. The behavior of the server in this mode is identical to the behavior observed when users are forced to change their passwords after an administrative reset.

Default Value::
None

Allowed Values::
A valid timestamp in generalized time form (for example, a value of "20070409185811Z" indicates a value of April 9, 2007 at 6:58:11 pm GMT).

state-update-failure-policy::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies how the server deals with the inability to update password policy state information during an authentication attempt. In particular, this property can be used to control whether an otherwise successful bind operation fails if a failure occurs while attempting to update password policy state information (for example, to clear a record of previous authentication failures or to update the last login time). It can also be used to control whether to reject a bind request if it is known ahead of time that it will not be possible to update the authentication failure times in the event of an unsuccessful bind attempt (for example, if the backend writability mode is disabled).

Default Value::
reactive

Allowed Values::
[open]
======

ignore::
If a bind attempt would otherwise be successful, then do not reject it if a problem occurs while attempting to update the password policy state information for the user.

proactive::
Proactively reject any bind attempt if it is known ahead of time that it would not be possible to update the user's password policy state information.

reactive::
Even if a bind attempt would otherwise be successful, reject it if a problem occurs while attempting to update the password policy state information for the user.

Password Validators of type character-set-password-validator have the following properties:
--

allow-unclassified-characters::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether this password validator allows passwords to contain characters outside of any of the user-defined character sets and ranges. If this is "false", then only those characters in the user-defined character sets and ranges may be used in passwords. Any password containing a character not included in any character set or range will be rejected.

Default Value::
None

====

character-set::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies a character set containing characters that a password may contain and a value indicating the minimum number of characters required from that set. Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the set which may be zero, indicating that the character set is optional) followed by a colon and the characters to include in that set (for example, "3:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" indicates that a user password must contain at least three characters from the set of lowercase ASCII letters). Multiple character sets can be defined in separate values, although no character can appear in more than one character set.

Default Value::
If no sets are specified, the validator only uses the defined character ranges.

Allowed Values::
A String

Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No

====

character-set-ranges::

Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the range which may be zero, indicating that the character range is optional) followed by a colon and one or more range specifications. A range specification is 3 characters: the first character allowed, a minus, and the last character allowed. For example, "3:A-Za-z0-9". The ranges in each value should not overlap, and the characters in each range specification should be ordered.

Default Value::
If no ranges are specified, the validator only uses the defined character sets.

====

min-character-sets::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the minimum number of character sets and ranges that a password must contain. This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets and ranges (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets and ranges (those requiring greater than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets and ranges, and characters from at least N optional character sets and ranges. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.

Default Value::
The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and ranges and, if there are optional character sets and ranges, at least one character from one of the optional character sets and ranges.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

====

Description::
The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments. Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.

Default Value::
1000ms

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

* `w`: weeks

+
Lower limit is 1 milliseconds.

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No

====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is "algorithm/mode/padding". The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.

confidentiality-enabled::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the replication change-log should make records readable only by Directory Server. Throughput and disk space are affected by the more expensive operations taking place. Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting records on all domains managed by this replication server. Encrypting the records prevents unauthorized parties from accessing contents of LDAP operations. For complete protection, consider enabling secure communications between servers. Change number indexing is not affected by the setting.

db-evictor-lru-only::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the database should evict existing data from the cache based on an LRU policy (where the least recently used information will be evicted first). If set to "false", then the eviction keeps internal nodes of the underlying Btree in the cache over leaf nodes, even if the leaf nodes have been accessed more recently. This may be a better configuration for databases in which only a very small portion of the data is cached.

db-evictor-nodes-per-scan::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of Btree nodes that should be evicted from the cache in a single pass if it is determined that it is necessary to free existing data in order to make room for new information. Changes to this property do not take effect until the backend is restarted. It is recommended that you also change this property when you set db-evictor-lru-only to false. This setting controls the number of Btree nodes that are considered, or sampled, each time a node is evicted. A setting of 10 often produces good results, but this may vary from application to application. The larger the nodes per scan, the more accurate the algorithm. However, don't set it too high. When considering larger numbers of nodes for each eviction, the evictor may delay the completion of a given database operation, which impacts the response time of the application thread. In JE 4.1 and later, setting this value too high in an application that is largely CPU bound can reduce the effectiveness of cache eviction. It's best to start with the default value, and increase it gradually to see if it is beneficial for your application.

db-log-filecache-size::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the size of the file handle cache. The file handle cache is used to keep as much opened log files as possible. When the cache is smaller than the number of logs, the database needs to close some handles and open log files it needs, resulting in less optimal performances. Ideally, the size of the cache should be higher than the number of files contained in the database. Make sure the OS number of open files per process is also tuned appropriately.

db-txn-no-sync::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether database writes should be primarily written to an internal buffer but not immediately written to disk. Setting the value of this configuration attribute to "true" may improve write performance but could cause the most recent changes to be lost if the OpenDJ directory server or the underlying JVM exits abnormally, or if an OS or hardware failure occurs (a behavior similar to running with transaction durability disabled in the Sun Java System Directory Server).

Analyzing indexes requires gathering search filter usage patterns from user requests, especially for values as specified in the filters and subsequently looking the status of those values into the index files. When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

db-directory-permissions::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the permissions that should be applied to the directory containing the server database files. They should be expressed as three-digit octal values, which is the traditional representation for UNIX file permissions. The three digits represent the permissions that are available for the directory's owner, group members, and other users (in that order), and each digit is the octal representation of the read, write, and execute bits. Note that this only impacts permissions on the database directory and not on the files written into that directory. On UNIX systems, the user's umask controls permissions given to the database files.

Default Value::

When a search requests is processed, internal or user generated, a first phase uses indexes to find potential entries to be returned. Depending on the search filter, if the index of one of the specified attributes matches too many entries (exceeds the index entry limit), the search becomes non-indexed. In any case, all entries thus gathered (or the entire DIT) are matched against the filter for actually returning the search result.

preload-time-limit::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the length of time that the backend is allowed to spend "pre-loading" data when it is initialized. The pre-load process is used to pre-populate the database cache, so that it can be more quickly available when the server is processing requests. A duration of zero means there is no pre-load.

Default Value::
0s

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

[#dsconfig-set-connection-handler-prop-ldap-connection-handler]
==== LDAP Connection Handler
Connection Handlers of type ldap-connection-handler have the following properties:
--

accept-backlog::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the maximum number of pending connection attempts that are allowed to queue up in the accept backlog before the server starts rejecting new connection attempts. This is primarily an issue for cases in which a large number of connections are established to the server in a very short period of time (for example, a benchmark utility that creates a large number of client threads that each have their own connection to the server) and the connection handler is unable to keep up with the rate at which the new connections are established.

Default Value::
128

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 1.

Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
The Connection Handler must be disabled and re-enabled for changes to this setting to take effect

Advanced Property::
Yes (Use --advanced in interactive mode.)

Read-only::
No

====

allow-ldap-v2::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether connections from LDAPv2 clients are allowed. If LDAPv2 clients are allowed, then only a minimal degree of special support are provided for them to ensure that LDAPv3-specific protocol elements (for example, Configuration Guide 25 controls, extended response messages, intermediate response messages, referrals) are not sent to an LDAPv2 client.

Default Value::
true

Allowed Values::

allow-start-tls::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether clients are allowed to use StartTLS. If enabled, the LDAP Connection Handler allows clients to use the StartTLS extended operation to initiate secure communication over an otherwise insecure channel. Note that this is only allowed if the LDAP Connection Handler is not configured to use SSL, and if the server is configured with a valid key manager provider and a valid trust manager provider.

Default Value::

====

allow-tcp-reuse-address::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the LDAP Connection Handler should reuse socket descriptors. If enabled, the SO_REUSEADDR socket option is used on the server listen socket to potentially allow the reuse of socket descriptors for clients in a TIME_WAIT state. This may help the server avoid temporarily running out of socket descriptors in cases in which a very large number of short-lived connections have been established from the same client system.

num-request-handlers::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the number of request handlers that are used to read requests from clients. The LDAP Connection Handler uses one thread to accept new connections from clients, but uses one or more additional threads to read requests from existing client connections. This ensures that new requests are read efficiently and that the connection handler itself does not become a bottleneck when the server is under heavy load from many clients at the same time.

Default Value::
Let the server decide.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 1.

====

ssl-cert-nickname::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the nicknames (also called the aliases) of the keys or key pairs that the LDAP Connection Handler should use when performing SSL communication. The property can be used multiple times (referencing different nicknames) when server certificates with different public key algorithms are used in parallel (for example, RSA, DSA, and ECC-based algorithms). When a nickname refers to an asymmetric (public/private) key pair, the nickname for the public key certificate and associated private key entry must match exactly. A single nickname is used to retrieve both the public key and the private key. This is only applicable when the LDAP Connection Handler is configured to use SSL.

Default Value::
Let the server decide.

Allowed Values::

====

use-tcp-keep-alive::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether the LDAP Connection Handler should use TCP keep-alive. If enabled, the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is used to indicate that TCP keepalive messages should periodically be sent to the client to verify that the associated connection is still valid. This may also help prevent cases in which intermediate network hardware could silently drop an otherwise idle client connection, provided that the keepalive interval configured in the underlying operating system is smaller than the timeout enforced by the network hardware.

Default Value::
true

==== Crypto Manager
Crypto Managers of type crypto-manager have the following properties:
--

cipher-key-length::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the key length in bits for the preferred cipher.

Default Value::
128

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

+
Changes to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.

Advanced Property::
Yes (Use --advanced in interactive mode.)

Read-only::
No

====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server using the syntax algorithm/mode/padding. The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.

Default Value::
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

Allowed Values::
A String

Multi-valued::
No

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
None

+
Changes to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.

Read-only::
No

====

ssl-cert-nickname::
[open]
====

The property can be used multiple times (referencing different nicknames) when server certificates with different public key algorithms are used in parallel (for example, RSA, DSA, and ECC-based algorithms). When a nickname refers to an asymmetric (public/private) key pair, the nickname for the public key certificate and associated private key entry must match exactly. A single nickname is used to retrieve both the public key and the private key. This is only applicable when the Crypto Manager is configured to use SSL.

Default Value::
Let the server decide.

Allowed Values::
A String

Multi-valued::
Yes

Required::
No

Admin Action Required::
The Crypto Manager must be disabled and re-enabled for changes to this setting to take effect

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No

====

ssl-cipher-suite::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the names of the SSL cipher suites that are allowed for use in SSL or TLS communication.

Default Value::
Uses the default set of SSL cipher suites provided by the server's JVM.

Password Validators of type character-set-password-validator have the following properties:
--

allow-unclassified-characters::
[open]
====

Description::
Indicates whether this password validator allows passwords to contain characters outside of any of the user-defined character sets and ranges. If this is "false", then only those characters in the user-defined character sets and ranges may be used in passwords. Any password containing a character not included in any character set or range will be rejected.

character-set::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies a character set containing characters that a password may contain and a value indicating the minimum number of characters required from that set. Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the set which may be zero, indicating that the character set is optional) followed by a colon and the characters to include in that set (for example, "3:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" indicates that a user password must contain at least three characters from the set of lowercase ASCII letters). Multiple character sets can be defined in separate values, although no character can appear in more than one character set.

Default Value::
If no sets are specified, the validator only uses the defined character ranges.

Allowed Values::
A String

Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the range which may be zero, indicating that the character range is optional) followed by a colon and one or more range specifications. A range specification is 3 characters: the first character allowed, a minus, and the last character allowed. For example, "3:A-Za-z0-9". The ranges in each value should not overlap, and the characters in each range specification should be ordered.

Default Value::
If no ranges are specified, the validator only uses the defined character sets.

====

min-character-sets::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the minimum number of character sets and ranges that a password must contain. This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets and ranges (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets and ranges (those requiring greater than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets and ranges, and characters from at least N optional character sets and ranges. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.

Default Value::
The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and ranges and, if there are optional character sets and ranges, at least one character from one of the optional character sets and ranges.

Allowed Values::
An integer value. Lower value is 0.

Default Value::
2000ms

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

Default Value::
not-assured

Allowed Values::
[open]
======

not-assured::
Assured replication is not enabled. Updates sent for replication (for being replayed on other LDAP servers in the topology) are sent without waiting for any acknowledgment and the LDAP client call returns immediately.

safe-data::
Assured replication is enabled in Safe Data mode: updates sent for replication are subject to acknowledgment from the replication servers that have the same group ID as the local server (defined with the group-id property). The number of acknowledgments to expect is defined by the assured-sd-level property. After acknowledgments are received, LDAP client call returns.

safe-read::
Assured replication is enabled in Safe Read mode: updates sent for replication are subject to acknowledgments from the LDAP servers in the topology that have the same group ID as the local server (defined with the group-id property). After acknowledgments are received, LDAP client call returns.

====

Description::
The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments. Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.

Default Value::
1000ms

Allowed Values::
Some property values take a time duration. Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units. For example `1 s` means one second, and `2 w` means two weeks. Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units, so you cannot necessary specify every duration in milliseconds or weeks for example. Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited. Units are specified as follows.

* `ms`: milliseconds

* `s`: seconds

* `m`: minutes

* `h`: hours

* `d`: days

* `w`: weeks

+
Lower limit is 1 milliseconds.

Multi-valued::

Advanced Property::
No

Read-only::
No

====

cipher-transformation::
[open]
====

Description::
Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is "algorithm/mode/padding". The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.
