  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   OpenDJ is a high-performance, highly-extensible, pure Java directory server.
   The server is fully compliant with the LDAPv3 standard,
   and passes all of the compliance, interoperability and security tests suites.
   The directory server implements most of the standard
   and experimental LDAP extensions defined in the IETF as RFCs or Internet-Drafts,
   ensuring maximum interoperability with LDAP client applications.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenDJ software includes a rich set of APIs making the directory server easy to extend.
   The directory server supports a loosely consistent multi-master replication model
   that guarantees high availability of data for all operations, searches or updates.
   While theoretically unlimited with regard to the number of masters,
   the directory server has been stressed under heavy and durable load with four masters.
