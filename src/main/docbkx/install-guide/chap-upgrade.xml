 <para>This chapter covers upgrade from OpenDJ 2.4.5 and later versions.</para>

 <para>For upgrades from earlier versions, upgrade first to at least OpenDJ
 2.4.5, and then follow the procedures in this chapter. See <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/OpenDJ+Installation+Guide#OpenDJInstallationGuide-UpgradingOpenDJDirectoryServer"
 >Upgrading OpenDJ Directory Server</link> in the OpenDJ Wiki for details on
 upgrading to OpenDJ 2.4.5 from earlier versions.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="before-you-upgrade">
  <title>Before You Upgrade</title>

  <step>
   <para>Prepare to perform the upgrade procedure as the user who owns the
   OpenDJ server files. </para>

   <para>Make sure you have the credentials to run commands as the user who
   owns the server.</para>

   <xinclude:include href="../shared/itemizedlist-download.xml" />
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>In order to revert should the upgrade fail, make sure you perform a
   full backup of your current OpenDJ installation.</para>

   <para>It might be most expedient to back up the file system directory where
   the current OpenDJ server is installed as part of the upgrade process.</para>

   <para>Alternatively, see <link xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-backup-restore"

  <title>To Upgrade an OpenDJ Directory Server</title>

  <para>To upgrade OpenDJ directory server installed from native packages (.deb,
  .rpm), use the package management tools provided by the system.</para>

  <para>The following steps describe how to upgrade OpenDJ directory server
  installed from the cross-platform (.zip) delivery.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Login as the user who owns the current OpenDJ server.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Stop the current OpenDJ server.</para>
  </step>

  <step performance="optional">
   <para>If you have not already backed up the current OpenDJ server, make a
   back up copy of the directory where OpenDJ is installed.</para>
  </step>

  <step performance="optional">
   <para>If OpenDJ is currently installed in a directory such as
   <filename>OpenDJ-2.4.5</filename>, you can change the directory name to
   <filename>opendj</filename> to make it easier to unpack subsequent .zip
   deliveries for future upgrades.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Unpack the new files from the .zip delivery over the current server
   files.</para>

   <para>If your directory is not named <filename>opendj</filename>, then
   you can first unpack the files, then copy everything in the
   <filename>opendj</filename> over the current server files.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Run the <command>upgrade</command> command to bring OpenDJ
   configuration and application data up to date with the new binary and
   script files that you copied over the current server files.</para>

   <para>By default, the <command>upgrade</command> command requests
   confirmation before making important configuration changes. You can use
   the <option>--no-prompt</option> option to run the command
   non-interactively.</para>

   <para>When using the <option>--no-prompt</option> option, if the
   <command>upgrade</command> command cannot complete because it requires
   confirmation for a potentially very long or critical task, then it exits
   with an error and a message about how to finish making the changes. You can
   add the <option>--force</option> option to force a non-interactive upgrade
   to continue in this case, also performing long running and critical
   tasks.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Start the upgraded OpenDJ server.</para>

   <para>At this point the upgrade process is complete. See the resulting
   <filename>upgrade.log</filename> file for a full list of operations
   performed.</para>

  <title>Upgrading From OpenDJ 2.4.5</title>

  <para>The following example upgrades an OpenDJ 2.4.5 directory server
  installed in <filename>/path/to/OpenDJ-2.4.5</filename>, backing up the
  current server directory in case the upgrade process fails, and changing
  the directory name to <filename>/path/to/opendj</filename> to simplify
  future upgrades.</para>
