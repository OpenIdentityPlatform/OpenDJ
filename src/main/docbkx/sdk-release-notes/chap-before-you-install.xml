   OpenDJ LDAP SDK is a pure Java library.
   OpenDJ LDAP SDK therefore should run on any system with full Java support.
   OpenDJ software runs on a variety of operating systems,
   including but not limited to Solaris SPARC and x86,
   various Linux distributions,
   Microsoft Windows,
   and Apple Mac OS X.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   OpenDJ software requires Java 6 or 7,
   specifically at least the Java Standard Edition runtime environment.
   To build applications with OpenDJ LDAP SDK,
   you need the corresponding Java SDK.
  </para>

  <para>
   ForgeRock recommends that you keep your Java installation up to date
   with the latest security fixes.
