 <title>Backing Up &amp; Restoring Data</title>

 <para>OpenDJ lets you backup and restore your data either in compressed,
 binary format, or in LDAP Data Interchange Format. This chapter shows you how
 to backup and to restore OpenDJ data from archives, and explains portability
 of backup archives, as well as backing up server configuration
 information.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="backup">
  <title>Backing Up Directory Data</title>
  <indexterm><primary>Backup</primary></indexterm>
  <para>A <filename>bak/</filename> directory is provided when you install
  OpenDJ, as a location to save binary backups. When you create a backup,
  the <filename>bak/backup.info</filename> contains information about the
  archive.</para>
  
  <para>Archives produced by the <command>backup</command> command contain
  backups only of the directory data. Backups of server configuration are
  found in <filename>config/archived-configs/</filename>.</para>
 
  <procedure xml:id="backup-immediately">
   <title>To Back Up Data Immediately</title>

   <para>To perform online backup, you start backup as a task by connecting to
   the administrative port and authenticating as a user with the
   <literal>backend-backup</literal> privilege, and also setting a start time
   for the task by using the <option>--start</option> option.</para>

   <para>To perform offline backup when OpenDJ is stopped, you run the
   <command>backup</command> command without connecting to the server,
   authenticating, or requesting a backup task.</para>

    <para>Use one of the following alternatives.</para>

   <title>To Restore a Replica</title>
   <indexterm>
    <primary>Replication</primary>
    <secondary>Restoring from backup</secondary>
   </indexterm>
   
   <para>After you restore a replica from backup, replication brings the replica
   up to date with changes that happened after you created the backup. In order
   to bring the replica up to date, replication must apply changes that
   happened after the backup was made. Replication uses internal change log
   records to determine what changes to apply.</para>

   <para>Internal change log records are not kept forever, though. Replication
   is configured to purge the change log of old changes, preventing the log
   from growing indefinitely. Yet, for replication to determine what changes
   to apply to a restored replica, it must find change log records dating back
   at least to the last change in the backup. In other words, replication can
   bring the restored replica up to date <emphasis>as long as the change log
   records used to determine which changes to apply have not been
   purged</emphasis>.</para>

   <para>Therefore, when you restore a replicated server from backup, make sure
   the backup you use is newer than the last purge of the replication change
   log (default: 3 days). If all your backups are older than the replication
   purge delay, do not restore from a backup, but instead initialize a new
   replica as described in <link xlink:href="admin-guide#init-repl"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Initializing
   Replicas</citetitle></link>.</para>

   <step>
    <para>Restore the server database from the backup archive that you are
    sure is newer than the last purge of the replication change log.</para>
