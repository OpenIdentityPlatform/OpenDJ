How To Install OpenDJ
=====================
Once you have downloaded and unzipped the OpenDJ directory server binaries,
you can install OpenDJ in either of two modes:

   Java-based graphical tool that enables you to install and configure
   OpenDJ directory server, load it with data and get it running quickly.

   you for required information before the installation and configuration begin.

 * The system must have at least 100MB of disk space and 256MB of free memory
   to run OpenDJ directory server for evaluation purposes.
