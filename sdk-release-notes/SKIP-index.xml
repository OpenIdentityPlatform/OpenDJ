  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>
   OpenDJ LDAP SDK provides a set of modern, developer-friendly Java APIs
   as part of the OpenDJ product suite.
   The product suite includes the client SDK
   alongside command-line tools and sample code,
   a 100% pure Java directory server, and more.
   You can use OpenDJ LDAP SDK to create client applications
   for use with any server that complies with the
   <citetitle>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP):
    Technical Specification Road Map</citetitle>,
   <link
    xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4510"
    xlink:show="new"
   >RFC 4510</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenDJ LDAP SDK brings you easy-to-use connection management,
   connection pooling, load balancing, and all the standard LDAP operations
   to read and write directory entries.
   OpenDJ LDAP SDK also lets you build applications with capabilities
   defined in additional draft and experimental RFCs
   that are supported by modern LDAP servers.
