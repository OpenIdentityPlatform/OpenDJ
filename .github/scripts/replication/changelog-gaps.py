"""Finds the changes a replication server's changelog lacks (#1090, #1195).

A directory server numbers the changes it makes one after the other: CSNGenerator.newCSN()
adds one to the sequence number of the CSN for every change, whatever its time. A gap can
indicate an unpublished or lost change, but does not prove data loss: an offline message also
consumes a sequence number, and a replica recovering an empty RS from historical information
can reconstruct only changes whose values have not since been replaced. The convergence run
checks every RS so gaps can be investigated alongside replica data and logs.

Usage: changelog-gaps.py <base DN> <from ms> <to ms> [<changelogDb directory>]
       [--offline-snapshots <directory>]

Without a directory it reads the changelogDb as a tar stream on its standard input, as
"docker cp <container>:/opt/opendj/data/changelogDb -" writes it. It reports, for every
replica of the domain of <base DN>, the changes whose CSN time is between <from ms> and
<to ms>, and the sequence numbers missing between them. Captured offline states can identify an
offline message with the same replica and sequence. They do not prove that an update did not later
reuse the sequence after a restart: CSN time is logical and can be ahead of the real clock. The
matching offline message is reported for investigation, and the gap remains an error. Exit code 1:
a sequence number is missing;
2: the arguments or changelog cannot be read (no such domain, or it is encrypted).

What it cannot tell. A change lost at either end of a replica's changes in the window - its
last ones, or its first ones when no earlier change of the replica is in the changelog - leaves
no gap between two changes that are there; the data of the other replicas shows such a change
unless a later change of another server overwrites it.

A server restart need not leave a gap. A directory server that stops numbers its ReplicaOfflineMsg
like a change, and no log file holds the message - only the offline.state of the replica, the
newest one. But the message does not enter the ServerState of the replica
(ReplicaOfflineMsg.contributesToDomainState()), from whose newest change of its own the server
numbers again once it starts (CSNGenerator), so its first change after the restart takes the
sequence number of the message again, at a later time: the changes of the restarted server had
no gap in run 39834888428 (#1208). A service restart within a server process can behave differently.

The file format is the one of FileReplicaDB: every log file is cut into blocks of 256 bytes,
and every block after the first starts with a 4-byte offset (BlockLogWriter); in between, a
record is its length in 4 bytes and the bytes of its UpdateMsg, whose header is the message
type, the protocol version and the CSN as 28 hexadecimal characters (LDAPUpdateMsg).
