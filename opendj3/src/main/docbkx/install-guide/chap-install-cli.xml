   <para>Allow OpenDJ software to use at least 64K (65536) file descriptors
   to operate properly.</para>

   <para>How you set the maximum number of file descriptors per process

  <step>
   <para>If you plan to configure SSL or TLS to secure network
   communications between the server and client applications, get a
   properly signed digital certificate that your client applications
   recognize, such as one that fits with your organization's PKI or one
   provided by a recognized certificate authority.</para>

   <para>To use the certificate during installation, the certificate
   must be located in a key store provided with Java (JKS, JCEKS, PKCS#12),
   or on a PKCS#11 token. To import a signed certificate into a key store,
   you can use the Java <command>keytool</command> command.</para>

   <para>Unzip <filename>OpenDJ-<?eval ${docTargetVersion}?>.zip</filename>
   in the file system directory where you want to install the server.</para>

   <para>Unlike the web-based Quick Setup install, the <command>setup</command>
   command uses the directory where you unzipped the files as the installation
   directory, and does not ask you where to install OpenDJ. Therefore, if you
   want to install elsewhere on the file system, unzip the files in that
   location.</para>
  </step>
  
  <step>
   <para>Run the <command>setup --cli</command> command found in the
   <filename>OpenDJ-<?eval ${docTargetVersion}?></filename> directory.</para>

   <para>This command starts the setup program in interactive mode on the
   command line, prompting you for each option. Alternatively, use
   additional <command>setup</command> options to specify
   values for the options you choose during interactive mode, thus
   scripting the installation process. See <command>setup --help</command>
   and the notes below.</para>
   
   <indexterm><primary>Silent installation</primary></indexterm>
   <para>To perform a non-interactive, silent installation, provide all
   the options to configure OpenDJ, and then also use the <literal>-n</literal>
   or <literal>--no-prompt</literal> option.</para>
   
   <para>The <command>setup</command> command without the
   <literal>--cli</literal> option runs the Quick Start
   GUI installer with your local version of software, as does
   Java WebStart with a remote version of the software.</para>

    <para>Some notes on the options follow.</para>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Initial root user DN</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The root user Distinguished Name identifies a
        user who can perform all administrative and other operations
        allowed for the server, called root user due to the similarity
        to the UNIX root. The default, <literal>cn=Directory Manager</literal>,
        is a well-known name. If you have reason to be paranoid, you might
        opt for a different name.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Initial root user password</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The root user will use simple, password-based authentication.
        Later you can limit cleartext access to avoid snooping, but for
        now use a strong password here unless this is a throwaway server.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>LDAP port</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The default for LDAP is 389. If you are working as a user
        who cannot open port 389, setup suggests 1389 as a default.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Administration port</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This is the service entrance used to configure the server,
        run tasks, and so forth. The default is 4444.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Create base DNs</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>You need a base Distinguished Name, such as the default
        <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, to add directory data. If you
        already have LDIF, the base DN you want is the distinguished name
        suffix common to all entries in your LDIF. You can provide more than
        one base DN if your data belongs in more than one suffix.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Import LDIF</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>LDAP data interchange format is the standard text format for
       expressing LDAP data. If you have LDIF already, one reason you might
       not want to import the data at the same time you install is because
       your data uses attributes not defined in the default schema, and so
       you will wait to add schema definitions before you import.</para>

       <para>If you have a huge data set to import, you no doubt should
       also increase the import cache size, which you can do by passing
       a Java properties file. You might also prefer to perform data
       import offline.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Enable SSL and TLS</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>Enabling Secure Sockets Layer or Transport Layer Security lets
      you protect the network traffic between directory clients and your
      server.</para>
      <variablelist>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>SSL</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>SSL requires its own, separate port for LDAPS traffic. The
         default port for LDAPS is 636. If you are working as a user
         who cannot open port 636, setup suggests 1636 by default.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>TLS</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>TLS lets you use StartTLS to negotiate a secure connection
         between a client and server, starting from the same server port
         you configured for LDAP.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>X.509 certificates</term>
         <listitem>
          <para>The digital certificate you need for SSL and TLS can be
          self-signed and created on the fly. Trouble is, client
          applications view self-signed certificates like fake IDs, and
          so do not trust them. Self-signed certificates facilitate testing,
          but are not intended for production use.</para>
