 <para>You can upgrade from an earlier version of OpenDJ either directly
 from within the Java WebStart installer, or on the command-line using the
 <command>upgrade</command> command.</para>

 <note>
  <para>Upgrade from OpenDS 2.2 or OpenDJ 2.4 has been tested most thoroughly
  on Solaris, Mac OS X, and Linux. On Windows systems, export directory data
  to LDIF, start with a fresh installation of the OpenDJ software, and then
  import your data from LDIF.</para>

  <para>You must perform the upgrade procedure as the user who own the OpenDJ
  server. Make sure you have the credentials to run commands as the user who
