# This script may be used to request that the Directory Server shut down.
# It operates in two different ways, depending on how it is invoked.  If it
# is invoked without any arguments and a local PID file is available, then it
# will stop the server by sending a TERM signal to the process, and this
# script will wait until the server has stopped before exiting.  If any
# arguments were provided or there is no local PID file, then it will attempt
# to stop the server using an LDAP request.


# Capture the current working directory so that we can change to it later.
# Then capture the location of this script and the Directory Server instance
# root so that we can use them to create appropriate paths.
