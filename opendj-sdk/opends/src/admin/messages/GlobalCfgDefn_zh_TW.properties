synopsis=The Global Configuration contains properties that affect the overall operation of the OpenDS Directory Server .
property.add-missing-rdn-attributes.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server should automatically add any attribute values contained in the entry's RDN into that entry when processing an add request.
property.allow-attribute-name-exceptions.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server should allow underscores in attribute names and allow attribute names to begin with numeric digits (both of which are violations of the LDAP standards).
property.allowed-task.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of a Java class that may be invoked in the server.
property.allowed-task.description=Any attempt to invoke a task not included in the list of allowed tasks is rejected.
property.allowed-task.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If no values are defined, then the server does not allow any tasks to be invoked.
property.bind-with-dn-requires-password.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server should reject any simple bind request that contains a DN but no password.
property.bind-with-dn-requires-password.description=Although such bind requests are technically allowed by the LDAPv3 specification (and should be treated as anonymous simple authentication), they may introduce security problems in applications that do not verify that the client actually provided a password.
property.check-schema.synopsis=Indicates whether schema enforcement is active.
property.check-schema.description=When schema enforcement is activated, the Directory Server ensures that all operations result in entries are valid according to the defined server schema. It is strongly recommended that this option be left enabled to prevent the inadvertent addition of invalid data into the server.
property.default-password-policy.synopsis=Specifies the name of the password policy that is in effect for users whose entries do not specify an alternate password policy (either via a real or virtual attribute).
property.disabled-privilege.synopsis=Specifies the name of a privilege that should not be evaluated by the server.
property.disabled-privilege.description=If a privilege is disabled, then it is assumed that all clients (including unauthenticated clients) have that privilege.

property.entry-cache-preload.synopsis=Indicates whether or not to preload the entry cache on startup.
property.etime-resolution.synopsis=Specifies the resolution to use for operation elapsed processing time (etime) measurements.

property.etime-resolution.syntax.enumeration.value.nanoseconds.synopsis=Use nanosecond resolution.
property.idle-time-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that a client connection may remain established since its last completed operation.
property.idle-time-limit.description=A value of "0 seconds" indicates that no idle time limit is enforced.

property.invalid-attribute-syntax-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.accept.synopsis=The Directory Server silently accepts attribute values that are invalid according to their associated syntax. Matching operations targeting those values may not behave as expected.

property.invalid-attribute-syntax-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.warn.synopsis=The Directory Server accepts attribute values that are invalid according to their associated syntax, but also logs a warning message to the error log. Matching operations targeting those values may not behave as expected.
property.lookthrough-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of entries that the Directory Server should "look through" in the course of processing a search request.
property.lookthrough-limit.description=This includes any entry that the server must examine in the course of processing the request, regardless of whether it actually matches the search criteria. A value of 0 indicates that no lookthrough limit is enforced. Note that this is the default server-wide limit, but it may be overridden on a per-user basis using the ds-rlim-lookthrough-limit operational attribute.
property.max-allowed-client-connections.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of client connections that may be established at any given time
property.max-allowed-client-connections.description=A value of 0 indicates that unlimited client connection is allowed.
property.notify-abandoned-operations.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server should send a response to any operation that is interrupted via an abandon request.
property.notify-abandoned-operations.description=The LDAP specification states that abandoned operations should not receive any response, but this may cause problems with client applications that always expect to receive a response to each request.
property.proxied-authorization-identity-mapper.synopsis=Specifies the name of the identity mapper to map authorization ID values (using the "u:" form) provided in the proxied authorization control to the corresponding user entry.
property.proxied-authorization-identity-mapper.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced identity mapper must be enabled.

property.return-bind-error-messages.synopsis=Indicates whether responses for failed bind operations should include a message string providing the reason for the authentication failure.
property.return-bind-error-messages.description=Note that these messages may include information that could potentially be used by an attacker. If this option is disabled, then these messages appears only in the server's access log.
property.save-config-on-successful-startup.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server should save a copy of its configuration whenever the startup process completes successfully.
property.save-config-on-successful-startup.description=This ensures that the server provides a "last known good" configuration, which can be used as a reference (or copied into the active config) if the server fails to start with the current "active" configuration.
property.server-error-result-code.synopsis=Specifies the numeric value of the result code when request processing fails due to an internal server error.
property.single-structural-objectclass-behavior.synopsis=Specifies how the Directory Server should handle operations an entry does not contain a structural object class or contains multiple structural classes.
property.single-structural-objectclass-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.accept.synopsis=The Directory Server silently accepts entries that do not contain exactly one structural object class. Certain schema features that depend on the entry's structural class may not behave as expected.
property.single-structural-objectclass-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.reject.synopsis=The Directory Server rejects entries that do not contain exactly one structural object class.
property.single-structural-objectclass-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.warn.synopsis=The Directory Server accepts entries that do not contain exactly one structural object class, but also logs a warning message to the error log. Certain schema features that depend on the entry's structural class may not behave as expected.
property.size-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of entries that the Directory Server should return to the client durin a search operation.
property.size-limit.description=A value of 0 indicates that no size limit is enforced. Note that this is the default server-wide limit, but it may be overridden on a per-user basis using the ds-rlim-size-limit operational attribute.
property.smtp-server.synopsis=Specifies the address (and optional port number) for a mail server that can be used to send email messages via SMTP.

property.time-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that the Directory Server should spend processing a search operation.
property.time-limit.description=A value of 0 seconds indicates that no time limit is enforced. Note that this is the default server-wide time limit, but it may be overridden on a per-user basis using the ds-rlim-time-limit operational attribute.
property.workflow-configuration-mode.synopsis=Specifies the workflow configuration mode (auto vs. manual).
property.workflow-configuration-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.auto.synopsis=In the "auto" configuration mode, there is no workflow configuration. The workflows are created automatically based on the backend configuration. There is one workflow per backend base DN.
property.workflow-configuration-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.manual.synopsis=In the "manual" configuration mode, each workflow is created according to its description in the configuration.
