synopsis=The SMTP Account Status Notification Handler is a notification handler that sends email messages to end users and/or administrators whenever an account status notification is generated.
property.email-address-attribute-type.synopsis=Specifies which attribute in the user's entries may be used to obtain the email address when notifying the end user.
property.email-address-attribute-type.description=You can specify more than one email address as separate values. In this case, the OpenDS server sends a notification to all email addresses identified.
property.email-address-attribute-type.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If no email address attribute types are specified, then no attempt is made to send email notification messages to end users. Only those users specified in the set of additional recipient addresses are sent the notification messages.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SMTP Account Status Notification Handler is enabled. Only enabled handlers are invoked whenever a related event occurs in the server.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SMTP Account Status Notification Handler implementation.
property.message-subject.synopsis=Specifies the subject that should be used for email messages generated by this account status notification handler.
property.message-subject.description=The values for this property should begin with the name of an account status notification type followed by a colon and the subject that should be used for the associated notification message. If an email message is generated for an account status notification type for which no subject is defined, then that message is given a generic subject.
property.message-template-file.synopsis=Specifies the path to the file containing the message template to generate the email notification messages.
property.message-template-file.description=The values for this property should begin with the name of an account status notification type followed by a colon and the path to the template file that should be used for that notification type. If an account status notification has a notification type that is not associated with a message template file, then no email message is generated for that notification.
property.recipient-address.synopsis=Specifies an email address to which notification messages are sent, either instead of or in addition to the end user for whom the notification has been generated.
property.recipient-address.description=This may be used to ensure that server administrators also receive a copy of any notification messages that are generated.
property.recipient-address.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If no additional recipient addresses are specified, then only the end users that are the subjects of the account status notifications receive the notification messages.
property.sender-address.synopsis=Specifies the email address from which the message is sent. Note that this does not necessarily have to be a legitimate email address.
property.send-message-without-end-user-address.synopsis=Indicates whether an email notification message should be generated and sent to the set of notification recipients even if the user entry does not contain any values for any of the email address attributes (that is, in cases when it is not be possible to notify the end user).
property.send-message-without-end-user-address.description=This is only applicable if both one or more email address attribute types and one or more additional recipient addresses are specified.
