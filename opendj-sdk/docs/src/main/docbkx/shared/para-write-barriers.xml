 In order to avoid directory database file corruption
 after crashes or power failures on Linux systems,
 enable file system write barriers
 and make sure that the file system journaling mode is ordered.

 For details on how to enable write barriers
 and how to set the journaling mode for data,
 see the options for your file system
 in the <command>mount</command> command manual page.
