 <para>A directory resembles a dictionary or a phone book. If you know a
 word, you can look it up its entry in the dictionary to learn its definition
 or its pronunciation. If you know a name, you can look it up its entry in the
 phone book to find the telephone number and street address associated with the
 name. If you are bored, curious, or have lots of time, you can also read
 through the dictionary, phone book, or directory, entry after entry.</para>
 
 <para>Where a directory differs from a paper dictionary or phone book is
 in how entries are indexed. Dictionaries typically have one index: words
 in alphabetical order. Phone books, too: names in alphabetical order.
 Directories entries on the other hand are often indexed for multiple
 attributes, names, user identifiers, email addresses, telephone numbers.
 This means you can look up a directory entry by the name of the user the
 entry belongs to, but also by her user identifier, her email address, or
 her telephone number, for example.</para>

 <section xml:id="ldap-directory-history">
  <title>How Directories &amp; LDAP Evolved</title>
  
  <para>Phone companies have been managing directories for many decades. The
  Internet itself has relied on distributed directory services like DNS since
  the mid 1980s.</para>
  
  <para>It was not until the late 1980s, however, that experts from what is now
  the International Telecommunications Union brought forth the X.500 set of
  international standards, including Directory Access Protocol. The X.500
  standards specify Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) protocols and
  data definitions for general-purpose directory services. The X.500 standards
  were designed to meet the needs of systems built according to the X.400
  standards, covering electronic mail services.</para>
  
  <para>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol has been around since the early
  1990s. LDAP was originally developed as an alternative protocol that would
  allow directory access over Internet protocols rather than OSI protocols,
  and be lightweight enough for desktop implementations. By the mid 1990s, LDAP
  directory servers became generally available and widely used.</para>
  
  <para>Until the late 1990s, LDAP directory servers were designed primarily
  with quick lookups and high availability for lookups in mind. LDAP directory
  servers replicate data, so when an update is made, that update gets pushed
  out to other peer directory servers. Thus if one directory server goes down
  lookups can continue on other servers. Furthermore, if a directory service
  needs to support more lookups, the administrator can simply add another
  directory server to replicate with its peers.</para>
  
  <para>As organizations rolled out larger and larger directories serving more
  and more applications, they discovered that they needed high availability
  not only for lookups, but also for updates. Around 2000 directories began
  to support multi-master replication, that is replication with multiple
  read-write servers. Soon thereafter the organizations with the very largest
  directories started to need higher update performance as well as
  availability.</para>
  
  <para>The OpenDJ code base began in the mid 2000s, when engineers solving the
  update performance issue decided the cost of adapting the existing C-based
  directory technology for high performance updates would be higher than the
  cost of building a next generation, high performance directory using Java
  technology.</para>

  <para>LDAP directory data is organized into entries, similar to the entries
  for words in the dictionary, or for subscriber names in the phone book.
  A sample entry follows.</para>

  <programlisting language="LDIF">dn: uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
uid: bjensen
cn: Babs Jensen
cn: Barbara Jensen
facsimileTelephoneNumber: +1 408 555 1992

ou: People
ou: Product Development
roomNumber: 0209
sn: Jensen
telephoneNumber: +1 408 555 1862
uidNumber: 1076
</programlisting>

  <para>Barbara Jensen's entry has a number of attributes, such as
  <literal>uid: bjensen</literal>,
  <literal>telephoneNumber: +1 408 555 1862</literal>, and
  <literal>objectClass: posixAccount</literal><footnote><para>The
  <literal>objectClass</literal> attribute type indicates which types of
  attributes are allowed and optional for the entry. As the entries object
  classes can be updated online, and even the definitions of object classes
  and attributes are expressed as entries that can be updated online, directory
  data is extensible on the fly.</para></footnote>. When you look up her entry
  in the directory, you specify one or more attributes and values to match
  in the entries that come back as the result of your search. Typically the
  attributes you search for are indexed in the directory, so the directory
  server can retrieve them more quickly.<footnote><para>Attribute values
  do not have to be strings. The directory can use base64 encoding, however,
  to make binary attribute values, such as passwords, certificates, or photos,
  portable in text format.</para></footnote></para>
  
  <para>The entry also has a unique identifier, shown at the top of the entry, 
  <literal>dn: uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>. DN stands
  for distinguished name. No two entries in the directory have the same
  distinguished name.<footnote><para>Sometimes your distinguished names include
  characters that you must escape. The following example shows an entry that
  includes escaped characters in the DN.</para>
  <screen>$ ldapsearch --port 1389 --baseDN dc=example,dc=com "(uid=escape)"
dn: cn=\" # \+ \, \; \&lt; = \&gt; \\ DN Escape Characters,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: top
givenName: " # + , ; &lt; = &gt; \
uid: escape
cn: " # + , ; &lt; = &gt; \ DN Escape Characters
sn: DN Escape Characters
mail: escape@example.com</screen></footnote></para>
  
  <para>LDAP entries are arranged hierarchically in the directory. The
  hierarchical organization resembles a file system on a PC or a web server,
  often imagined as an upside-down tree structure, looking similar to a
  pyramid.<footnote><para>Hence pyramid icons are associated with directory
  servers.</para></footnote>The distinguished name consists of components
  separated by commas,
  <literal>uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>. Those components
  reflect the hierarchy of directory entries.</para>

  <para>Barbara Jensen's entry is located under an entry with DN
  <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>, an organization unit and
  parent entry for the people at Example.com. The
  <literal>ou=People</literal> entry is located under the entry with DN
  <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, the root entry for Example.com.
  DC stands for domain component. The directory has other root entries, such
  as <literal>cn=config</literal>, under which the configuration is accessible
  through LDAP, and potentially others such as
  <literal>dc=mycompany,dc=com</literal> or <literal>o=myOrganization</literal>.
  Thus when you look up entries, you specify the parent entry to look under
  in the same way you need to know whether to look in the New York, Paris,
  or Tokyo phone book to find a telephone number.<footnote>
  <para>The root entry for the directory, technically the entry with DN
  <literal>""</literal> (the empty string), is called the root DSE, and
  contains information about what the server supports, including the other
  root entries it serves.</para></footnote></para>

  <para>You may be used to web service client server communication, where
  each time the web client has something to request of the web server, a
  connection is set up and then torn down. LDAP has a different model. In
  LDAP the client application connects to the server and authenticates, then
  requests any number of operations perhaps processing results in between
  requests, and finally disconnects when done.</para>

  <itemizedlist xml:id="standard-ldap-operations">
   <para>The standard operations are as follows.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>Bind (authenticate). The first operation in an LDAP session involves
    the client binding to the LDAP server, with the server authenticating the
    client. Authentication identifies the client's identity in LDAP terms, the
    identity which is later used by the server to authorize (or not) access
    to directory data that the client wants to lookup or change.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Search (lookup). After binding, the client can request that the server
    return entries based on an LDAP filter, which is an expression that the
    server uses to find entries that match the request, and a base DN under
    which to search. For example, to lookup all entries for people with email
    address <literal>bjensen@example.com</literal> in data for Example.com,
    you would specify a base DN such as
    <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal> and the filter
    <literal>(mail=bjensen@example.com)</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Compare. After binding, the client can request that the server
    compare an attribute value the client specifies with the value stored
    on an entry in the directory.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Modify. After binding, the client can request that the server
    change one or more attribute values stored on one or more entries. Often
    administrators do not allow clients to change directory data, so request
    that your administrator set appropriate access rights for your client
    application if you want to update data.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Add. After binding, the client can request to add one or more
    new LDAP entries to the server. </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Delete. After binding, the client can request that the server
    delete one or more entries. To delete and entry with other entries
    underneath, first delete the children, then the parent.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Modify DN. After binding, the client can request that the server
    change the distinguished name of the entry. For example, if Barbara
    changes her unique identifier from <literal>bjensen</literal> to something
    else, her DN would have to change. For another example, if you decide
    to consolidate <literal>ou=Customers</literal> and
    <literal>ou=Employees</literal> under <literal>ou=People</literal>
    instead, all the entries underneath much change distinguished names.
    <footnote><para>Renaming entire branches of entries can be a major
    operation for the directory, so avoid moving entire branches if you
    can.</para></footnote></para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Unbind. When done making requests, the client should request an
    unbind operation to release resources right away for other clients.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Abandon. When a request seems to be taking too long to complete,
    or when a search request returns many more matches than desired, the client
    can send an abandon request to the server to drop the operation in
    progress. The server then drops the connection without a reply to the
    client.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </section>
 
 <section xml:id="standard-ldapv3-extensions">
  <title>Standard LDAPv3 &amp; Extensions</title>
  <para>LDAP has standardized two mechanisms for extending the kinds of
  operations that directory servers can perform. One mechanism involves using
  LDAP controls. The other mechanism involves using LDAP extended
  operations.</para>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Controls</primary>
   <secondary>About</secondary>
  </indexterm>
  <para>LDAP controls are information added to an LDAP message to further
  specify how an LDAP operation should be processed. For example, the
  Server Side Sort Request Control modifies a search to request that the
  directory server return entries to the client in sorted order. The Subtree
  Delete Request Control modifies a delete to request that the server
  also remove child entries of the entry targeted for deletion.</para>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Extended operations</primary>
   <secondary>About</secondary>
  </indexterm>
  <para>LDAP extended operations are additional LDAP operations not included
  in the original standard list. For example, the Cancel Extended Operation
  works like an abandon operation, but finishes with a response from the
  server after the cancel is complete. The StartTLS Extended Operation allows
  a client to connect to a server on an unsecure port, but then start
  Transport Layer Security negotiations to protect communications.</para>
  
  <para>Both LDAP controls and extended operations are demonstrated later in
  this guide. OpenDJ directory server supports many LDAP controls and a few
  LDAP extended operations, controls and extended operations matching those
  demonstrated in this guide.</para>
