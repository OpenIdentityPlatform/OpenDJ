  <title>The open source LDAP directory services in Java</title>

  <section name="About the OpenDJ Project">
   <p>The OpenDJ community actively develops open source directory services,
   including a high performance, highly available, secure directory server,
   built-in data replication, client tools, and an LDAP SDK. OpenDJ offers
   extensive LDAPv3 support. OpenDJ DSML gateway enables applications
   accessing directory data through DSMLv2. All modules are 100% Java based
   and require Java 1.6.</p>
   <p>Coming soon on the <a
   href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/OpenDJ+Roadmap"
   >OpenDJ Roadmap</a>, you see that the community plans to add RESTful web
   services access to the directory, and to develop directory proxy services
   with virtual directory capabilities such as data mapping and connectors
   for non-directory data sources.</p>
