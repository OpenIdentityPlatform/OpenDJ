For specifying ignored differences, see:
  http://mojo.codehaus.org/clirr-maven-plugin/examples/ignored-differences.html

path/methods/to/from matching can either use:
- regex when surrounded with '%regex[]'
- ant style path matching when surrounded with '%ant[]'
- ant style path matching when not surrounded by anything

For path/methods matching in maven-clirr-plugin see (change version numbers accordingly):
  http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/tags/clirr-maven-plugin-2.6.1/src/main/java/org/codehaus/mojo/clirr/Difference.java
  http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.codehaus.plexus/plexus-utils/3.0.7/org/codehaus/plexus/util/SelectorUtils.java
For a description of ant style path expressions see:
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns

Note: waiting on https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCLIRR-62 to be resolved to avoid the need to use \s* in the '<to>' tags.
