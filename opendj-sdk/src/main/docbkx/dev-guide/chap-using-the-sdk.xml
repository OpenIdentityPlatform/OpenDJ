 <title>Using the LDAP SDK</title>

 <para>As LDAP relies on a connection from the client to the directory server,
 the starting point for working with the LDAP SDK is a new
 <literal>LDAPConnectionFactory</literal>, from which you then get either
 a synchronous connection, or pass in a handler to an asynchronous
 connection. You then use the connection to make requests and get responses
 from the directory server.</para>

   <secondary>Asynchronous</secondary>
  </indexterm>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Connections</primary>
   <secondary>Synchronous</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>For synchronous operations your application gets a connection from
  the <literal>LDAPConnectionFactory</literal> and requests operations on
  the connection. When finished, your application closes the connection.</para>

  <programlisting language="java">
[jcp:org.forgerock.opendj.examples.Search:--- JCite ---]
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   For a complete example in context, see
   <link
    xlink:href="../resources/org/forgerock/opendj/examples/Search.java"
    xlink:show="new"
   >Search.java</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For asynchronous operations,
   your application obtains a connection with
   <literal>LDAPConnectionFactory.getConnectionAsync()</literal>,
   and then uses promises to handle the bind, the subsequent operations,
   the results, and any errors in asynchronous fashion.
  </para>

  <programlisting language="java">
[jcp:org.forgerock.opendj.examples.SearchAsync:--- Using Promises ---]
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   When the factory gets a connection,
   your application passes an <literal>AsyncFunction</literal>
   to apply to the connection to handle the bind
   by using the <literal>thenAsync()</literal> method in the fluent style.
   Your application uses <literal>thenAsync()</literal> again
   to pass another <literal>AsyncFunction</literal> to perform the operation.
   In the sample shown here, the second call to <literal>thenAsync()</literal>
   passes a function that performs a search, passing in a handler
   to deal with the search results returned by the directory server.
   The call to <literal>onSuccess()</literal> handles the final result,
   with the call to <literal>onFailure()</literal> dealing with exceptions.
  </para>

  <para>
   Asynchronous methods are non-blocking, returning a <literal>Promise</literal>,
   so that you can chain methods in the fluent style.
   Your application must coordinate concurrency
   when you use asynchronous operations.
  </para>

   For a complete example in context, see
   <link

  <title>Managing Errors</title>

   <primary>Errors</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>LDAP <link xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#appendix-A"
  xlink:show="new">defines many result codes</link> to deal with conditions
  other than success. The <literal>ResultCode</literal> class encapsulates the
  LDAP codes and additional client-side codes specific to the SDK.</para>

  <para>
   Your application deals with most non-success result codes
   by catching <literal>LdapException</literal> objects
   or handling them when supplied to <literal>FailureHandler</literal> objects
   passed to <literal>onFailure()</literal> methods.
   Your application can then take remedial action based on the result code,
   as in the following synchronous example.
  </para>

  <programlisting language="java">
final LDAPConnectionFactory factory = new LDAPConnectionFactory(host, port);
Connection connection = null;

try {
    connection = factory.getConnection();
    connection.bind(name, password);

    // Perform operations on the connection...

} catch (final LdapException e) {

    // Take remedial action based on the result code...
    // e.getResult().getResultCode() returns the code for you to interpret.

} finally {
    if (connection != null) {
        connection.close();
    }
}
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   Also notice the methods <literal>ResultCode.getName()</literal>
   that provides a short, human-readable version of the result code,
   and <literal>Result.getDiagnosticMessage()</literal>
   that can help to debug problems after the fact.
  </para>

  <para>
   When you have completely finished with a connection,
   then use the <literal>close()</literal> method on it.
  </para>
