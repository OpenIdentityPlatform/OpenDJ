 <title>Tuning Servers For Performance</title>
 <indexterm><primary>Performance tuning</primary></indexterm>
 
 <para>Server tuning refers to the art of adjusting server, JVM, and system
 configuration to meet the service level performance requirements of directory
 clients. In the optimal case you achieve service level performance
 requirements without much tuning at all, perhaps only setting JVM runtime
 options when installing OpenDJ.</para>
 
 <para>If you are reading this chapter, however, you are probably not
 facing an optimal situation. Instead you are looking for trade offs that
 maximize performance for clients given the constraints of your deployment.
 This chapter therefore aims to provide suggestions on how to measure and
 to improve directory service performance for better trade offs.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="perf-define-starting-points">
  <title>Defining Performance Requirements &amp; Constraints</title>
  
  <para>Your key performance requirement is most likely to satisfy your
  users or customers with the resources available to you. Before you can
  solve potential performance problems, define what those users or customers
  expect, and determine what resources you will have to satisfy their
  expectations.</para>
  
  <section xml:id="perf-sla">
   <title>Service-Level Agreements</title>
   
   <para>Service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal name for what directory
   client applications and the people who run them expect from your service in
   terms of performance.</para>
   
   <para>SLAs might cover many aspects of the directory service. Whether or not
   your SLA is formally defined, you ought to know what is expected, or at least
   what you provide, in the following four areas.</para>
   
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Directory service <firstterm>response times</firstterm></para>
     
     <para>Directory service response times range from less than a
     millisecond on average across a low latency connection on the same
     network to however long it takes your network to deliver the response.
     More important than average or best response times is the response time
     distribution, because applications set timeouts based on worst case
     scenarios. For example, a response time performance requirement might
     be defined as, "Directory response times must average less than 10
     milliseconds for all operations except searches returning more than 10
     entries, with 99.9% of response times under 40 milliseconds."</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Directory service <firstterm>throughput</firstterm></para>
     
     <indexterm>
      <primary>Replication</primary>
      <secondary>Write throughput</secondary>
     </indexterm>
     <para>Directory service throughput can range up to many thousands of
     operations per second. In fact there is no upper limit for read operations
     such as searches, because only write operations must be replicated. To
     increase read throughput, simply add additional replicas. More important
     than average throughput is peak throughput. You might have peak write
     throughput in the middle of the night when batch jobs update entries in
     bulk, and peak binds for a special event or first thing Monday morning.
     For example, a throughput performance requirement might be expressed as,
     "The directory service must sustain a mix of 5,000 operations per second
     made up of 70% reads, 25% modifies, 3% adds, and 2% deletes."</para>
     
     <para>Even better is to mimic the behavior of key operations for
     performance testing, so that you understand the patterns of operations
     in the throughput you need to provide.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Directory service <firstterm>availability</firstterm></para>
     
     <para>OpenDJ is designed to let you build directory services that are
     basically available, including during maintenance and even upgrade of
     individual servers. Yet, in order to reach very high levels of
     availability, you must make sure not only that the software is
     designed for availability, but also that your operations execute in
     such a way as to preserve availability. Availability requirements
     can be as lax as best effort, or as stringent as 99.999% or more
     uptime.</para>
     
     <para>Replication is the OpenDJ feature that allows you to build a
     highly available directory service.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Directory service administrative support</para>
     
     <para>Do not forget to make sure you understand and set expectations
     about how you support your users when they run into trouble. Directory
     services can perhaps help you turn password management into a self-service
     visit to a web site, but some users no doubt still need to know what they
     can expect if they need your help.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   
   <para>Writing down the SLA, even if your first version consists of
   guesses, helps you reduce performance tuning from an open-ended project
   to a clear set of measurable goals for a manageable project with a definite
   outcome.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section xml:id="perf-constraints">
   <title>Available Resources</title>
   
   <para>With your SLA in hand, take inventory of the server, networks,
   storage, people, and other resources at your disposal. Now is the time to
   estimate whether it is possible to meet the requirements at all.</para>
   
   <para>If for example you are expected to serve more throughput than the
   network can transfer, maintain high availability with only one physical
   machine, store 100 GB of backups on a 50 GB partition, or provide 24/7
   support all alone, no amount of tweaking available resources is likely to
   fix the problem.</para>
   
   <para>When checking that the resources you have at least theoretically
   suffice to meet your requirements, do not forget that high availability in
   particular requires at least two of everything to avoid single points
   of failure. Be sure to list the resources you expect to have, when and how
   long you expect to have them, and why you need them. Also make note of
   what is missing and why.</para>
   
   <section xml:id="perf-hardware">
    <title>Server Hardware Recommendations</title>
   
    <para>Concerning server hardware, OpenDJ runs on systems with Java support,
    and is therefore quite portable. That said, OpenDJ tends to perform best on
    single-board, x86 systems due to low memory latency.</para>
   </section>
   
   <section xml:id="perf-storage">
    <title>Storage Recommendations</title>
    
    <para>OpenDJ is designed to work with local storage for the database,
    not for network file systems such as NFS.</para>
    
    <para>High performance storage is essential if you need to handle high
    write throughput.</para>
    
    <para>The Berkeley Java Edition DB works well with traditional disks as
    long as the database cache size allows the DB to stay fully cached in
    memory. This is the case because the database transaction log is append
    only. When the DB is too big to stay cached in memory, however, then
    cache misses lead to random disk access, slowing OpenDJ performance.</para>
    
    <para>You might mitigate this effect by using solid-state disks for
    persistent storage, or for file system cache.</para>
    
    <para>Regarding database size on disk, if you have sustained write traffic
    then the database grows to about twice its initial size on disk. This is
    normal, and due to the way the database manages its logs. The size on disk
    does not impact the DB cache size requirements.</para>
   </section>
  </section>
 </section>
 
 <section xml:id="perf-testing">
  <title>Testing Performance</title>
  
  <para>Even if you do not need high availability, you still need two of
  everything, because your test environment needs to mimic your production
  environment as closely as possible if you want to avoid nasty
  surprises.</para>
  
  <para>In your test environment, you set up OpenDJ as you will later in
  production, and then conduct experiments to determine how best to meet
  the requirements defined in the SLA.</para>
  
  <para>Use <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="admin-guide#make-ldif-1"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">make-ldif</link> to generate
  sample data that match what you expect to find in production.</para>
  
  <para>The OpenDJ LDAP Toolkit provides three command-line tools to help
  with basic performance testing.</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>The <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="dev-guide#authrate-1"

    <para>The <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="dev-guide#searchrate-1"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">searchrate</link> command
    measures search throughput and response time.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>All three commands show you information about the response time
  distributions, and allow you to perform tests at specific levels of
  throughput.</para>

  <para>If you need additional precision when evaluating response times, use
  the global configuration setting <literal>etime-resolution</literal> to
  change elapsed processing time resolution from milliseconds (default) to
  nanoseconds.</para>

  <para>For more extensive testing, try the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="http://dl.thezonemanager.com/slamd/">SLAMD Distributed Load
  Generation Engine</link>. SLAMD is built to test more than just directory,
  but is particularly well suited to test directory service performance, is
  well documented, and is available under the Sun Public License. SLAMD is
  designed both to offer an easy to used web-based interface, and also to
  allow you to customize jobs to match the access patterns you expect from
  client applications.</para>

  <title>Tweaking OpenDJ Performance</title>
  
  <para>When your tests show that OpenDJ performance is lacking even though
  you have the right underlying network, hardware, storage, and system
  resources in place, you can tweak OpenDJ performance in a number of ways.
  This section mentions the most common tweaks.</para>
  
  <section xml:id="perf-java">
   <title>Java Settings</title>
   
   <para>Default Java settings let you evaluate OpenDJ using limited system
   resources. If you need high performance for production system, test with
   the following JVM options. These apply to the Sun/Oracle JVM.</para>

   <para>By default, OpenDJ compressing attribute descriptions and object class

   <para>By default, OpenDJ does not however compress entries stored in its
   backend database. If your entries hold values that compress well &#8212;
   such as text, and not JPEG photos or MP3 audio &#8212; you can gain space
   by setting the local DB backend property
   <literal>entries-compressed</literal> to <literal>true</literal> before you
   (re-)import data from LDIF. With <literal>entries-compressed: true</literal>
   OpenDJ compresses entries before writing them to the database.<footnote>
   <para>OpenDJ does not proactively rewrite all entries in the database after

   <para>By default, the temporary directory used for scratch files is

  <section xml:id="perf-db-cache">
   <title>Database Cache Settings</title>
   
   <para>Database cache size is, by default, set as a percentage of the JVM
   heap, using the backend property <literal>db-cache-percent</literal>.
   Alternatively, you use the backend property
   <literal>db-cache-size</literal> to set the size. If you set up multiple
   database backends, the total percent of JVM heap used must remain less than
   100, and must leave space for other uses. Default settings work for servers
   with one user data backend JVM heaps up to 2 GB. For heaps larger than 2 GB,
   you can allocate a larger percentage of heap space to DB cache.</para>
   
   <para>Depending on the size of your database, you have a choice to make
   about database cache settings.</para>
   
   <para>By caching the entire database in the JVM heap, you can get more
   deterministic response times and limit disk I/O. Yet, caching the whole
   DB can require a very large JVM, which you must pre-load on startup, and
   which can result in long garbage collections and a difficult-to-manage
   JVM. Test database pre-load on startup by setting the
   <literal>preload-time-limit</literal> for the backend.</para>

   <para>Database pre-load is single-threaded, and loads each database one
   at a time.</para>
   
   <para>By allowing file system cache to hold the portion of database that
   does not fit in DB cache, you trade less deterministic and slightly slower
   response times for not having to pre-load the DB and not having garbage
   collection pauses with large JVMs. How you configure the file system cache
   depends on your operating system.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section xml:id="perf-entry-cache">
   <title>Entry Cache Settings</title>
   
   <para>OpenDJ implements an entry cache. The entry cache is not designed to
   cache every entry in your database, but is instead useful in cases where you
   have a few, typically large entries that are regularly used. For example, if
   you have a few large static groups and applications that regularly check
   group membership, you could cache your group entries.</para>
