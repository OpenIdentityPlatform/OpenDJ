 <title>Managing Data Replication</title>

 <para>OpenDJ uses advanced data replication with automated conflict
 resolution to help ensure your directory services remain available in the
 event a server crashes or a network goes down, and also as you backup or
 upgrade your directory service. You can configure data replication as part
 of OpenDJ installation, and in many cases let replication do its work in
 the background.</para>

  <para>Before you take replication further than setting up replication
  in the setup wizard, read this section to learn more about how OpenDJ
  replication works.</para>

  <section xml:id="repl-what-it-is">
   <title>What Replication Is</title>

   <para>Replication is the process of copying updates between OpenDJ
   directory servers such that all servers converge on identical copies of
   directory data. Replication is designed to let convergence happen over
   time by default. <footnote><para>Assured replication can require, however,
   that the convergence happen before the client application is notified that
   the operation was successful.</para></footnote> Letting convergence
   happen over time means that different replicas can be momentarily out of
   sync, but it also means that if you lose an individual server or even an
   entire data center, your directory service can keep on running, and then
   get back in sync when the servers are restarted or the network is
   repaired.</para>

   <para>Replication is specific to the OpenDJ directory service. Replication
   uses a specific protocol that replays update operations quickly, storing
   enough historical information about the updates to resolve most conflicts
   automatically. For example, if two client applications separately update
   a user entry to change the phone number, replication can work out which
   was the latest change, and apply that change across servers. The historical
   information needed to resolve these issues is periodically purged to avoid
   growing larger and larger forever. As a directory administrator, you must
   ensure that you do not purge the historical information more often than you
   backup your directory data.</para>

   <para>Keep server clocks synchronized for your topology. You can use NTP for
   example. Keeping server clocks synchronized helps prevent issues with SSL
   connections and with replication itself. Keeping server clocks synchronized
   also makes it easier to compare timestamps from multiple servers.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="repl-per-suffix">
   <title>Replication Per Suffix</title>

   <para>The primary unit of replication is the suffix, specified by a
   base DN such as <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>.<footnote><para>When
   you configure partial and fractional replication, however, you can replicate
   only part of a suffix, or only certain attributes on entries. Also,
   if you split your suffix across multiple backends, then you need to set up
   replication separately for each part of suffix in a different backend.</para>
   </footnote> Replication also depends on the directory schema, defined on
   <literal>cn=schema</literal>, and the <literal>cn=admin data</literal>
   suffix with administrative identities and certificates for protecting
   communications. Thus that content gets replicated as well.</para>

   <para>The set of OpenDJ servers replicating data for a given suffix is
   called a replication topology. You can have more than one replication
   topology. For example, one topology could be devoted to
   <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, and another to
   <literal>dc=example,dc=org</literal>. OpenDJ servers are capable of
   serving more than one suffix. They are also capable of participating in
   more than one replication topology.</para>

   <mediaobject xml:id="figure-replication-topologies-right">
    <alt>Three replication topologies set up correctly</alt>
    <imageobject>
     <imagedata fileref="images/repl-topologies-right.png" format="PNG" />
    </imageobject>
    <textobject>
     <para>In this figure, all OpenDJ servers serve the replicated suffix
     <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>. Only servers A and B serve
     <literal>dc=example,dc=org</literal>. Only server C and D serve
     <literal>dc=example,dc=net</literal>.</para>
    </textobject>
   </mediaobject>

   <para>Within a replication topology, the suffixes being replicated are
   identified to the replication servers by their DN. As all the replication
   servers are fully connected in a topology, a consequence is that it is
   impossible to have multiple "sub-topologies" within the overall set of
   servers as illustrated in the following diagram.</para>

     connected for <literal>dc=example,dc=org</literal>.</para>
    </textobject>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="repl-connection-selection">
   <title>Replication Connection Selection</title>

   <para>In order to understand what happens when individual servers stop
   responding due to a network partition or a crash, know that OpenDJ can
   offer both directory service and also replication service, and the two
   services are not the same, even if they can run alongside each other in
   the same OpenDJ server in the same Java Virtual Machine.</para>

   <para>Replication relies on the replication service provided by OpenDJ
   replication servers, where OpenDJ directory servers publish changes made
   to their data, and subscribe to changes published by other OpenDJ directory
   servers. A replication server manages replication data only, handling
   replication traffic with directory servers and with other replication
   servers, receiving, sending, and storing only changes to directory data
   rather than directory data itself. Once a replication server is connected
   to a replication topology, it maintains connections to all other
   replication servers in that topology.</para>

   <para>A directory server handles directory data. It responds to requests,
   stores directory data and historical information. For each replicated
   suffix, such as <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>,
   <literal>cn=schema</literal> and <literal>cn=admin data</literal>, the
   directory server publishes changes to a replication server, and subscribes
   to changes from that replication server. (Directory servers do not publish
   changes to other directory servers.) A directory server also resolves any
   conflicts that arise when reconciling changes from other directory servers,
   using the historical information about changes to resolve the conflicts.
   (Conflict resolution is the responsibility of the directory server rather
   than the replication server.)</para>

   <para>Once a directory server is connected to a replication topology for a
   particular suffix, it connects to one replication server at a time for that
   suffix. The replication server provides the directory server with a list of
   all replication servers for that suffix. Given the list of possible
   replication servers to which it can connect, the directory server can
   determine which replication server to connect to when starting up, or when
   the current connection is lost or becomes unresponsive.</para>

   <orderedlist>
    <para>For each replicated suffix, a directory server prefers to connect to
    a replication server:</para>

    <listitem>
     <para>In the same group as the directory server</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Having the same initial data for the suffix as the directory
     server</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>If initial data were the same, having all the latest changes from
     the directory server</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Running in the same Java Virtual Machine as the directory
     server</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>Having the most available capacity relative to other eligible
     replication servers</para>

     <para>Available capacity depends on how many directory servers in the
     topology are already connected to a replication server, and what
     proportion of all directory servers in the topology ought to be connected
     to the replication server.</para>

     <para>To determine what proportion of the total number of directory
     servers should be connected to a replication server, OpenDJ uses
     replication server weight. When configuring a replication server, you
     can assign it a weight (default: 1). The weight property takes an integer
     that indicates capacity to provide replication service relative to other
     servers. For example, a weight of 2 would indicate a replication server
     that can handle twice as many connected servers as a replication server
     with weight 1.</para>

     <para>The proportion of directory servers in a topology that should be
     connected to a given replication server is equal to (replication server
     weight)/(sum of replication server weights). In other words, if there are
     4 replication servers in a topology each with default weights, the
     proportion for each replication server is 1/4.</para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>

   <para>Consider a situation where 7 directory servers are connected to
   replication servers A, B, C, and D for <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>
   data. Suppose 2 directory servers each are connected to A, B, and C, and 1
   directory server is connected to replication server D. Replication server D
   is therefore the server with the most available capacity relative to other
   replication servers in the topology. All other criteria being equal,
   replication server D is the server to connect to when an 8th directory
   server joins the topology.</para>

   <para>The directory server regularly updates the list of replication servers
   in case it must reconnect. As available capacity of replication servers for
   each replication topology can change dynamically, a directory server can
   potentially reconnect to another replication server to balance the
   replication load in the topology. For this reason the server can also end
   up connected to different replication servers for different suffixes.</para>

   <para>Replication in OpenDJ is designed to be both easy to implement in
   environments with a few servers, and also scalable in environments with
   many servers. You can enable the replication service on each OpenDJ
   directory server in your deployment, for example, to limit the number
   of servers you deploy. Yet in a large deployment, you can use stand-alone
   replication servers &#8212; OpenDJ servers that do nothing but relay
   replication messages &#8212; to configure (and troubleshoot) the replication
   service separately from the directory service. You only need a few
   stand-alone replication servers publishing changes to serve many directory
   servers subscribed to the changes. Furthermore, replication is designed
   such that you need only connect a directory server to the nearest
   replication server for the directory server to replicate with all others
   in your topology. Yet only the stand-alone replication servers participate
   in fully-meshed replication.</para>
   

   <para>All replication servers in a topology are connected to all other
   replication servers. Directory servers are connected only to one replication
   server at a time, and their connections should be to replication servers on
   the same LAN. Therefore the total number of replication connections,
   Total<subscript>conn</subscript> is expressed as follows.</para>
   
   <equation>
    <mathphrase>Total<subscript>conn</subscript> = (N<subscript>RS</subscript> *
    N<subscript>RS</subscript>-1)/2 + N<subscript>DS</subscript></mathphrase>
   </equation>
   
   <para>Here, N<subscript>RS</subscript> is the number of replication servers,
   and N<subscript>DS</subscript> is the number of stand-alone directory
   servers. In other words, if you have only 3 servers, then
   Total<subscript>conn</subscript> is 3 with no stand-alone servers.
   However, if you have two data centers, and need 12 directory servers, then
   with no stand-alone directory servers Total<subscript>conn</subscript> is
   (12 * 11)/2 or 66. Yet, with 4 stand-alone replication servers, and 12
   stand-alone directory servers, Total<subscript>conn</subscript> is
   (4 * 3)/2 + 12, or 18, with only four of those connections needing to go
   over the WAN. (By running four directory servers that also run replication
   servers and eight stand-alone directory servers, you reduce the number of
   replication connections to 14 for 12 replicas.)</para>

    server, and then configure the server to work with a separate, stand-alone
    replication server instead. Start by using the <command>dsreplication
    disable --disableReplicationServer</command> command to turn off the
    replication service on the server.</para>
