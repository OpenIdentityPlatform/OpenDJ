 <title>Maximum Open Files</title>

 <para>
  OpenDJ needs to be able to open many file descriptors,
  especially when handling thousands of client connections.

  Linux systems in particular often set a limit of 1024 per user,
  which is too low to handle many client connections to OpenDJ.
 </para>

 <para>
  When setting up OpenDJ for production use,
  make sure OpenDJ can use at least 64K (65536) file descriptors.

  For example when running OpenDJ as user <literal>opendj</literal>
  on a Linux system that uses
  <filename>/etc/security/limits.conf</filename> to set user level limits,
  you can set soft and hard limits by adding these lines to the file:
 </para>

 <programlisting language="none">opendj soft nofile 65536
opendj hard nofile 131072</programlisting>

 <para>
  The example above assumes the system has
  enough file descriptors available overall.

  You can check the Linux system overall maximum as follows.
 </para>

 <screen>$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
