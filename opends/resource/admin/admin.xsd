      This schema defines the XML schema elements and attributes which
      should be used to specify the server's configuration model.
      Broadly speaking, there are three main components to this schema:
      managed objects, properties, and relations. Using these components
      it is possible to model the server's configuration based on its
      configurable components (managed objects), their configurable
      attributes (properties), and their relationships with other
      configurable components (relations).

    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>
        Defines the structure of a configurable component within the
        configuration. A managed object comprises of zero or more
        properties, and zero or more relations with other managed
        objects. A managed object can be abstract, indicating that it
        cannot be instantiated directly, and that it is intended as a
        base definition from which other child managed objects inherit
        their behavior. Conversely, a managed object can be derived from
        a parent managed object definition. In this case, the managed
        object will inherit the properties and relations defined by the
        parent. Multiple levels of inheritance are supported, but
        multiple inheritance is not.

            are not performed during value validation. Instead they are
            performed when changes to the managed object are committed.

        Defines the structure of a configurable component within the
        configuration. A managed object comprises of zero or more
        properties, and zero or more relations with other managed
        objects. A managed object can be abstract, indicating that it
        cannot be instantiated directly, and that it is intended as a
        base definition from which other child managed objects inherit
        their behavior. Conversely, a managed object can be derived from
        a parent managed object definition. In this case, the managed
        object will inherit the properties and relations defined by the
        parent. Multiple levels of inheritance are supported, but
        multiple inheritance is not.
