This folder contains source code for an example "Hello World" style
plugin. It features a plugin which has a configurable message (the
default being "Hello World") which is displayed as a notice message
when an OpenDS instance is started.

In order to build and use this example plugin, perform the following
steps (presumably you are already at step 4):
 
  1. In the top-level source folder for OpenDS, first build and
     package OpenDS:

     ./build.sh

  2. Next go into the packages folder:

     cd build/package/OpenDS-0.1

  3. Then unzip the example-plugin.zip (in place):

     unzip example-plugin.zip

  4. Go into the example-plugin source folder:

     cd example-plugin

  5. And build the plugin (this requires Ant in your path):

     ant install

  6. This will copy the following files into the parent OpenDS
     installation:

     lib/extensions/example-plugin.jar
     config/example-plugin.ldif
     config/schema/99-example-plugin.ldif

  7. Add the plugin's config to the server configuration. The
     following instruction assumes usage of the Unix 'cat'
     command, but obviously ldapadd can be used:

     cd ../config
     cat example-plugin.ldif >> config.ldif

  8. Start the server and look for the "hello world" notice in the start
     up log:
     
     cd ..
     ./bin/start-ds
