  <adm:synopsis>
    The
    <adm:user-friendly-name />
    provides a mechanism for encoding user passwords using an unsalted
    form of the MD5 message digest algorithm. Because the implementation 
    does not use any kind of salting mechanism, a given password always 
    has the same encoded form.
  </adm:synopsis>
  <adm:description>
    This scheme contains only an implementation for the user password
    syntax, with a storage scheme name of "MD5". Although the MD5 digest 
    algorithm is relatively secure, recent cryptanalysis work has 
    identified mechanisms for generating MD5 collisions. This does not 
    impact the security of this algorithm as it is used in OpenDS, but it 
    is recommended that the MD5 password storage scheme only be used if 
    client applications require it for compatibility purposes, and that a 
    stronger digest like SSHA or SSHA256 be used for environments in which 
    MD5 support is not required.
