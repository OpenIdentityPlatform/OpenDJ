user-friendly-plural-name=Similarity Based Password Validators
synopsis=The Similarity Based Password Validator determines whether a proposed password is acceptable by measuring how similar it is to the user's current password.
description=In particular, it uses the Levenshtein Distance algorithm to determine the minimum number of changes (where a change may be inserting, deleting, or replacing a character) to transform one string into the other. It can be used to prevent users from making only minor changes to their current password when setting a new password. Note that for this password validator to be effective, it is necessary to have access to the user's current password. Therefore, if this password validator is to be enabled, the password-change-requires-current-password attribute in the password policy configuration must also be set to true.
