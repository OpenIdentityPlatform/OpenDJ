property.allowed-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.allowed-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All clients with addresses that do not match an address on the deny list are allowed. If there is no deny list, then all clients are allowed.
property.allowed-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this configuration attribute take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.

If only a denied list is specified, then any client not matching a mask in that list is allowed.
