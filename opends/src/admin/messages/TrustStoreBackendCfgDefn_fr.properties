user-friendly-name=Trust Store Backend
user-friendly-plural-name=Trust Store Backends
synopsis=The Trust Store Backend provides an LDAP view of a file-based trust store. It is used by the administrative cryptographic framework.
property.backend-id.synopsis=Specifies a name to identify the associated backend.
property.backend-id.description=The name must be unique among all backends in the server. The backend ID may not be altered after the backend is created in the server.
property.base-dn.synopsis=Specifies the base DN(s) for the data that the backend handles.
property.base-dn.description=A single backend may be responsible for one or more base DNs. Note that no two backends may have the same base DN although one backend may have a base DN that is below a base DN provided by another backend (similar to the use of sub-suffixes in the Sun Java System Directory Server). If any of the base DNs is subordinate to a base DN for another backend, then all base DNs for that backend must be subordinate to that same base DN.
property.base-dn.requires-admin-action.synopsis=No administrative action is required by default although some action may be required on a per-backend basis before the new base DN may be used.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the backend is enabled in the server.
property.enabled.description=If a backend is not enabled, then its contents are not accessible when processing operations.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the backend implementation.
property.trust-store-file.synopsis=Specifies the path to the file that stores the trust information.
property.trust-store-file.description=It may be an absolute path, or a path that is relative to the OpenDS Directory Server instance root.
property.trust-store-pin.synopsis=Specifies the clear-text PIN needed to access the Trust Store Backend .
property.trust-store-pin.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property will take effect the next time that the Trust Store Backend is accessed.
property.trust-store-pin-environment-variable.synopsis=Specifies the name of the environment variable that contains the clear-text PIN needed to access the Trust Store Backend .
property.trust-store-pin-environment-variable.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property will take effect the next time that the Trust Store Backend is accessed.
property.trust-store-pin-file.synopsis=Specifies the path to the text file whose only contents should be a single line containing the clear-text PIN needed to access the Trust Store Backend .
property.trust-store-pin-file.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property will take effect the next time that the Trust Store Backend is accessed.
property.trust-store-pin-property.synopsis=Specifies the name of the Java property that contains the clear-text PIN needed to access the Trust Store Backend .
property.trust-store-pin-property.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property will take effect the next time that the Trust Store Backend is accessed.
property.trust-store-type.synopsis=Specifies the format for the data in the key store file.
property.trust-store-type.description=Les valeurs valides doivent toujours inclure 'JKS' et 'PKCS12', mais des impl\u00e9mentations diff\u00e9rentes peuvent accepter d'autres valeurs. 
property.trust-store-type.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=The JVM default value is used.
property.trust-store-type.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect the next time that the key manager is accessed.
property.writability-mode.synopsis=Specifies the behavior that the backend should use when processing write operations.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.disabled.synopsis=Causes all write attempts to fail.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.enabled.synopsis=Allows write operations to be performed in that backend (if the requested operation is valid, the user has permission to perform the operation, the backend supports that type of write operation, and the global writability mode property is also enabled).
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.internal-only.synopsis=Causes external write attempts to fail but allows writes by replication and internal operations.
